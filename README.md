# Data Globe
A more generic version of https://github.com/dataarts/armsglobe for visualizing source/destination data.

This fork attempts to make the globe data-agnostic so that users can simply provide source/destination data and have it graphed. If timestamp information is provided, this globe can act as a semi-real-time visualization.
